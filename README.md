# dse-halfday-workshop

This is a half day workshop that takes students through the entire DSE platform. It is based around CX/Fraud Detection at the fictional DS Bank.

A PowerPoint presentation will walk the students through DSE. It is broken into multiple sections each with a hands on exercise:

* DSE Core
* DSE Search
* DSE Analytics
